# AI-Internship-Role-Predictor
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting suitable internship roles for students using Machine Learning techniques. The system analyzes student academic performance, technical skills, certifications, and project experience to recommend the most relevant internship domain.

The aim of this project is to assist students in making informed career decisions and applying to roles aligned with their strengths.

Features:

Predicts internship domain based on student profile

Uses Machine Learning classification model

Supports multiple input attributes such as skills, GPA, and projects

Provides instant prediction output

Can be extended into a web-based career guidance tool

Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

 Machine Learning Approach:

The system uses a classification algorithm such as Decision Tree or Random Forest to analyze student data and predict internship roles.
The model is trained on sample student datasets and evaluated using accuracy metrics.

 Expected Output:

The system predicts internship domains such as:
